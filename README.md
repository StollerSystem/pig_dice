#### Pig Dice the Game! 08/24/2020

#### By _**Drew Lockhart & Ben Stoller**_

## Description

Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a die until either a 1 is rolled or the player decides to "hold":

* If the player rolls a 1, they score nothing and it becomes the next player's turn.
* If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn total and the player's turn continues.
* If a player chooses to "hold", their turn total is added to their score, and it becomes the next player's turn.
* The first player to score 100 or more points wins.


## Specs

* [X] The game takes two players, starting with player one they roll 1 die 

* [X] each player can roll a die as many times as they want until they get a 1

* [X] for each roll that is not a one, the player adds the dice total to their turn score

* [X] if a player decides to "hold" their turn is over and their turn score is added to their total score 

* [X] the first player to get a total score of 100 or more wins the pig
